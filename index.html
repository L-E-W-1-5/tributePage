   <h2>General Information</h2>
   <p id="tribute-info">I decided to set up a tribute page about Cornwall simply because its where i'm originally from and i no longer get a chance to visit.<br>I thought this could be a way to remind myself of all the county has to offer whilst at the same time informing others why it's a great place to visit, with maybe a little history too.
   </p>

       <h4><u>Things To Do</u></h4>
       
       <dt><b>The Eden Project</b></dt>
       <dd>The number one place to visit upon arriving in Cornwall is The Eden Project. The site consists of two huge biomes containing hundreds of different plant species usually found in more tropical climates.</dd>
       <br>
       <dt><b>The Lost Gardens Of Heligan</b></dt>
       <dd>Another attraction related to flora and fauna but you really must see either one of the two. This is more of a large, wild, outdoor expanse of gardens, split into two parts, one with more of a jungle type feel and the other, more Pride and Prejudice.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><b>Flambards Theme Park</b></dt>
        <dd>If you happen to have children with you for your trip to Cornwall, this is maybe the most likely place to entertain them out of the three. Although that isn't guaranteed if they have already been to Alton Towers for example.. if they have, you might be more popular frog marching them around a garden.</dd>

   <h4><u>History</u></h4>
   <p>If you have the chance to take in some of Cornwalls rich history, heres a couple of interesting options..</p>
   <ul>
       <li><i>Tintagel Castle</i> really is a must see, found amongst the rugged sights of the north coast, this impressive castle is linked with the legend of King Arthur. Its a fascinating day out and suitable for the whole family.</li>
       <li>
       <li><i>Bodmin Jail</i>. Now also including a hotel, this ancient debtors jail was also witness to countless executions over the roughly 150 years it operated, before finally shutting its doors after World War 1. Apparently haunted, this jail is a must see if you're brave enough. As a side note, i used to live just behind it and haunted or not, walking past it at night time on your own, with bats flying about was never a nice experience!</li>
   </ul>
