This is my first draft for a tribute page. The basic structure is ok but im not happy with the CSS. A lot of work needs to be done with it to make it look presentable.

Font - Style, Size, Colour, maybe layout.. maybe put into boxes to make the text clearer.

Background - Needs a better quality background photo, fixed position with maybe boxes of text scrolling in the foreground.

Footer - Needs more links, could include links to the websites of each of the attractions listed.

Navbar - Although a static page can be a navbar to take you to the different sections of the site - Things to see, history etc

Layout could be improved - Have a main content section in the center with an secondary, narrower section at either side, all properly marked with HTML5.
